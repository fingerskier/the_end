I am not a professor, nor a lecturer, not an engineer, or a scientist.
I am a dabbling technologist, a wanderable writer, and a musical eclecticist.
I am a child, husband, and father- in that order...chiastically.

Faced with my imminent demise I am now forced to distill and record what wisdom I have been blessed with.
This is, in some ways, monumental but, in other ways quite easy.
It begins at the beginning and ends tomorrow, or next year, or whenever.

Leadership

There are no natural-born leaders.
Anyone who says so forgets that they came into this world screaming:
starving to death until someone shoved a nipple in their mouth.



Followership

Passion

Meekness

Prophecy

Bovinity
Rumination is the key to success...and depression.
I don't mean solving depression, I mean being depressed.
And I don't mean success you can touch, I mean the a-ha moment where success starts.


Friends

Lovers

Debt

Legacy
